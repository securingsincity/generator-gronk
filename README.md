GRONK STACK Generator!
===============

Yeoman gronk (GULP REACT OBOE NODE KARMA) generator.

> very much a work in progress

##Why GRONK?

He's a demigod.

He's Hercules, Dionysus or Percy Jackson. Pretty sure he's all three actually.

##Getting started

Clone the repo

```
npm link
mkdir FOO
cd FOO
yo gronk
```

---
##Oboe Components
